Your current code includes multiple classes (Dice, Player, Attributes). 
This is good, but to better adhere to the idea of multiple modules, 
consider splitting these classes into separate Python files. 
For example:
dice.py for the Dice class.
player.py for the Player class.
attributes.py for the Attributes class.



You have some interaction between Player and Dice, but 
consider enhancing this by possibly adding more complex interactions 
or dependencies. For example, you could add a Game class that manages rounds 
and players.
