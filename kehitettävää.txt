Your current code includes multiple classes (Dice, Player, Attributes). 
This is good, but to better adhere to the idea of multiple modules, 
consider splitting these classes into separate Python files. 
For example:
dice.py for the Dice class.
player.py for the Player class.
attributes.py for the Attributes class.
